###[Q] title about CR goals
What task does this code accomplish? Please tell us, and also make that the title of the question via [edit]. Maybe you missed the placeholder on the title element: "_State the task that your code accomplishes. Make your title distinctive._". Also from  [How to Ask](https://$SITEURL$/questions/how-to-ask): "_State what your code does in your title, not your main concerns about it._".

###[Q] not workingg
Please inform yourself, [take the tour](https://$SITEURL$/tour), and read up at our [help center](https://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic) before posting here. Your question is _off-topic_ because this site is for reviewing **working** code, not implementing code for you. When you have implemented the code feel free to [edit] your post to include it for a review.

###[Q] broken
Unfortunately this post is off-topic for this site. Please read [What topics can I ask about here?](https://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic) - note that it states "_If you are looking for feedback on a specific **working** piece of code...then you are in the right place!_" Also, when posting your question, there should have been text on the side that read "_Your question **must contain code that is already working correctly**_..." When you have fixed the code, please [edit] your post to include the working code and it can be reviewed."

###[Q] stub code
Welcome to $SITENAME$. Unfortunately this question does not match what this site is about. Reviewers need more than hypothetical/stub code. For more information, see [this meta post](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3652/120114).

###[Q] untested
If you're not sure whether your code works correctly, I'm afraid it's not yet ready for review. $SITENAME$ is for finished code that you believe to be functionally correct.

###[Q] More than one question asked
It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions. Thanks!

###[Q] Duplicate Closure
This question will probably be closed as a duplicate soon. If the answers from the duplicates don't fully address your question please edit it to include why and flag this for re-opening. Thanks!

###[Q] Common title
What task does this code accomplish? Please tell us, and also make that the title of the question via [edit]. Maybe you missed the placeholder on the title element: "_State the task that your code accomplishes. Make your title distinctive._". Also from  [How to Ask](https://$SITEURL$/questions/how-to-ask): "_State what your code does in your title, not your main concerns about it._".

###[Q] Edited Title
I [changed the title]() so that it describes what the code does per [site goals](https://$SITEURL$/questions/how-to-ask): "_State what your code does in your title, not your main concerns about it._". Feel free to [edit] and give it a different title if there is something more appropriate.

###[Q] advice for future code
Questions asking for advice about [code not yet written](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3651/120114) are [off-topic](https://$SITEURL$/help/on-topic), as the code is not ready for review.

###[Q] 3rd party code link
Maybe you missed the text on the right side when asking: "_Your question must contain code that is already working correctly, and **the relevant code sections must be embedded in the question**._" Questions must [include the code to be reviewed](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/3653/120114). Links to code hosted on third-party sites are permissible, but the most relevant excerpts must be embedded in the question itself.

###[Q] Commented with more details
When adding additional information you should [edit] your question  instead of adding a comment. I have added that information to your post. Learn more about comments including when to comment and when not to in [the Help Center page about Comments](https://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment).

###[Q] Add answer instead of comment
Please add an answer instead of a comment. Refer to the section **When _shouldn't_ I comment?** on [Comment everywhere](https://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment).

###[Q] merge accounts
it appears you have a registered account (as evidenced by the suggested edit), which can be merged with your unregistered account. You can use the [contact SE page](https://$SITEURL$/contact) and request the accounts be merged.

###[Q] rolled back(200_success's)
Please see [_What to do when someone answers_](https://$SITEURL$/help/someone-answers). I have rolled back Rev 2 → 1

###[Q] don't update code
Please do not update the code in your question to incorporate feedback from answers, doing so goes against the Question + Answer style of $SITENAME$. This is not a forum where you should keep the most updated version in your question. Please see [_what you may and may not do after receiving answers_](http://meta.codereview.stackexchange.com/a/1765).

###[Q] code rolled back
I rolled back your last edit. After getting an answer you are not allowed to change your code anymore. This is to ensure that answers do not get invalidated and have to hit a moving target. If you have changed your code you can either post it as an answer (if it would constitute a code review) or ask a new question with your changed code (linking back to this one as reference). Refer to [this post](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1765/120114) for more information

###[Q] rolled back last edit (Graipher's)
I rolled back your last edit. After getting an answer you are [not allowed to change your code anymore](https://$SITEURL$/help/someone-answers). This is to ensure that answers do not get invalidated and have to hit a moving target. If you have changed your code you can either post it as an answer (if it would constitute a code review) or ask a new question with your changed code (linking back to this one as reference). Refer to [this post](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1765/120114) for more information

###[Q] SQL need more info
Please read the [sql tag wiki](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/tags/sql/info) - especially the **Question Guidelines** section. Before reviewing this code, it would be helpful to have some more information about the data. 

###[A] Nothing insightful
This answer doesn't really offer much for the OP. Please (re-) read [The help center page _How do I write a good answer?_](https://$SITEURL$/help/how-to-answer). Note it states: "_Every answer must make at least one **insightful observation** about the code in the question. Answers that merely provide an alternate solution with no explanation or justification do not constitute valid $SITENAME$ answers and may be deleted._"

###[A] don't answer off-topic questions
Please note, questions involving code that's not working as intended, are off-topic on this site. If OP edits their post to address the problem and make their post on-topic, they make your answer moot. [It is advised not to answer such questions](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6389/120114). Protip: There are tons of on-topic questions to answer; you'll make more reputation faster if you review code in questions that will get higher view counts for being on-topic.

###[A] don't answer questions likely to be closed
[Please refrain from answering questions that are likely to get closed.](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/6389/35991)

###[A] link-only answer
A link to a solution is welcome, but please ensure your answer is useful without it: [add context around the link](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why it’s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. [Answers that are little more than a link may be deleted](https://$SITEURL$/help/deleted-answers).

###[A] Doesn't answer question
This does not answer the question the OP posed (i.e. "_How can I make it run faster? How can I write it in a OOP paradigm, and will it run faster?_"). Please see [How do I write a good answer](https://$SITEURL$/help/how-to-answer) before posting an answer. If you have a related but separate question, you can [ask](https://$SITEURL$/questions/ask) another question and mention this question, or if you have code not working, try [SO].

###[A] alternative solution/ code dump
You have presented an alternative solution, but haven't reviewed the code. Please explain your reasoning (how your solution works and why it is better than the original) so that the author and other readers can learn from your thought process. Please read [Why are alternative solutions not welcome?](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/8404/120114)

###[A] follow up question
This does not really answer the question. If you have a different question, you can ask it by clicking [Ask Question](https://$SITEURL$/questions/ask), though only if you have **working code**. This statement would be appropriate as a  [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment), though you will need to earn 50 reputation points first...

###[A] Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](//$SITEURL$/privileges) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.

###[A] Requests to OP for further information
This is really a comment, not an answer. With a bit more rep, [you will be able to post comments](//$SITEURL$/privileges/comment). For the moment I've added the comment for you, and I'm flagging this post for deletion.

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should modify your original question to add additional information.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.

###[A] Another user adding a 'Me too!'
If you have a NEW question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button. If you have sufficient reputation, [you may upvote](//$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question. Alternatively, "star" it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers.

###[A] NAA self-answer on CR
While OPs are [encouraged to answer their own questions](https://$SITEURL$/help/self-answer) bear in mind that ["_Every answer must make at least one insightful observation about the code in the question. Answers that merely provide an alternate solution with no explanation or justification do not constitute valid $SITENAME$ answers and may be deleted._"](https://$SITEURL$/help/how-to-answer)...

###[C] Too localized
This question appears to be off-topic because it is too localized.

###[EQ] Improper tagging
The tags you were using are not appropritate for this question. Please review [What are tags, and how should I use them?](//$SITEURL$/help/tagging)
