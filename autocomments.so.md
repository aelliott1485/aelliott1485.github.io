###[Q] More than one question asked
It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions. Thanks!

###[Q] Duplicate Closure
This question will probably be closed as a duplicate soon. If the answers from the duplicates don't fully address your question please edit it to include why and flag this for re-opening. Thanks!

###[Q] VTC SO -> CR new
Please see [_Does being on-topic at another Stack Exchange site automatically make a question off-topic for $SITENAME$?_](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/287400/1575353), [_Migration of code questions from $SITENAME$ to Code Review_](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/266749/1575353) and [this answer to _A guide to Code Review for $SITENAME$ users_](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5778/120114)

###[Q] VTC SO -> CR
@ While this may be on-topic on CR, in the future, please don't use the existence of the Code Review site as a reason to close a question. Evaluate the request and use a reason like *Needs more focus*, *primarily opinion-based*, etc. Then you can mention to the OP that it can be posted on Code Review if it is [on-topic](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). Please see [_Does being on-topic at another Stack Exchange site automatically make a question off-topic for $SITENAME$?_](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/287400/1575353)

###[Q] answer in comment
please add an answer instead of a comment. Refer to the section **When _shouldn't_ I comment?** on [Comment everywhere](https://$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment).

###[Q] edit instead of comment
When adding additional information you should [edit] your question instead of adding a comment. Learn more about comments including when to comment and when not to in [the Help Center page about Comments](//$SITEURL$/help/privileges/comment).

###[Q] Which site and CR or not
See ["Which Site?"](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/129632/341145) and ["Code Review or not?"](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5778/120114)

###[Q] OP referred to CR
If you do post on CR please read the [_How do I ask a good question?_](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) - the requirements are a little different for that site.

###[Q] OP referred to CR about GBP
@loremipsum Please take a look at the CR Help center page [_What types of questions should I avoid asking?_](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) '_It's OK to ask "Does this code follow common best practices?", but not "What is the best practice regarding X?"_'. If the OP presented fully working code **with enough context** then that would be [on-topic](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).

###[Q] if you post on CR - read how do I ask
if you post on Code Review please read the help center pages like [_How do I ask a good question?_](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) - in its current form this post would be considered off-topic because there is little context about what the code does and how the function is used, plus the title is about CR goals instead of describing what the code does

### [Q] when recommending CR also recommend reading help center- missing context
@ when suggesting users post on CR it would be great if there was also a suggestion like "_Please read the relevant help center pages like '[What topics can I ask about here?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic)' and  '[How do I ask a good question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask)_". In the current form the code above would likely be closed as off-topic because it [is missing context](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3649/my-question-was-closed-as-being-off-topic-what-are-my-options/3652#3652).

###[Q] when recommending CR also recommend reading help center- code missing
@ when suggesting users post on CR it would be great if there was also a suggestion like "_Please read the relevant help center pages like '[What topics can I ask about here?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic)' and  '[How do I ask a good question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask)_". In the current form the code above would likely be closed as off-topic because [the code is not embedded directly](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3649/my-question-was-closed-as-being-off-topic-what-are-my-options/3653#3653).

### [Q] design off-topic on CR
The general consensus is that design questionss are not reviewable on CR unless they accompany code - thus in the current form this post would not be on-topic there.

###[Q] recommend SQL -> CR
@ when suggesting users post on CR it would be great if there was also a suggestion like "_Please read the relevant help center pages like '[What topics can I ask about here?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic)' and  '[How do I ask a good question?](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask)_". In the current form the code above would likely be closed as off-topic because it is missing context - the [sql tag](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/tags/sql/info) has specific guidelines and OPs should read the tag info first to include sufficient info.

###[Q] Be careful when recommending Code Review to askers
[Be careful when recommending Code Review to askers](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/253975/1575353)

###[Q] flagged for migration
I've flagged for migration to CR per [_this meta post_](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/266749/1575353)

###[Q] OP asking about complexity only - not on-topic
if the OP isn't interested in feedback about any or all facets of the code then it wouldn't really be [on-topic](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic) for CR. Please refer to [this meta answer](https://codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/a/8374/120114) (and its siblings) for more information.

###[Q] Why is “Can someone help me?" not an actual question
It sounds like more details about what isn't working are needed. You might want to read [Why is “Can someone help me?”](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/284237/1575353) not an actual question? and [How to ask](http://$SITEURL$/help/how-to-ask)

###[A] Answers just to say Thanks!
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient [privileges](//$SITEURL$/privileges) to upvote answers you like, which is the $SITENAME$ way of saying thank you.

###[A] Nothing but a URL (and isn't spam)
Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.

###[A] Requests to OP for further information
This is really a comment, not an answer. With a bit more rep, [you will be able to post comments](//$SITEURL$/privileges/comment). For the moment I've added the comment for you, and I'm flagging this post for deletion.

###[A] OP using an answer for further information
Please use the *Post answer* button only for actual answers. You should modify your original question to add additional information.

###[A] OP adding a new question as an answer
If you have another question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button.

###[A] Another user adding a 'Me too!'
If you have a NEW question, please ask it by clicking the [Ask Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) button. If you have sufficient reputation, [you may upvote](//$SITEURL$/privileges/vote-up) the question. Alternatively, "star" it as a favorite and you will be notified of any new answers.

###[C] Too localized
